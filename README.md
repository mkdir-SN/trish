# trish
Facebook Messenger bot built with Flask server and IBM Watson Visual Recognition service. Identifies pictures of trash and responds with where the trash belongs (compost, recycling, hazardous waste, or landfill) and provides recycling suggestions. 

DISCLAIMER

Most of Trish's waste sorting references fall under San Jose and San Francisco's government standards. Trish does not account for the diversity in the standards of other counties, cities, or etc. In addition, the negative samples include live animals which is subject to the developer's own beliefs.

Trish is not intended to be used as reliable source of sorting waste due to the lack of access to a large set of training data. Trish is designed to be a trash-sorting prototype.
